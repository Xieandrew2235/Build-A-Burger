# Assignment: Burger Time!
<hr>
<strong>Description: </strong> This page doesn't have a back story that's amazing like our previous apps such as Friend Finder and Bamazon, however it should be noted that this page has two skills, and two skills only: building any burger in the world, and then devouring it! Give it a shot with the weirdest combanation of a burger you can come out with, and then top it all off with the satisfaction and joy of downing the burger! (Drink devouring to come soon!)

## Instructions
<hr>

1. For this app, after you clone this repository to your desktop, you will then install all dependencies by running a *npm install* once you have opened bash and directed yourself to the folder containing this data.

2. Once you run the server.js file with Node, it will then tell you that you have been connected. You will then open up your web browser and go to *https://localhost:8080*. Once you have reached our burger home page, you will see images of a standard cheeseburger, along with a fried chicken burger (although you are encouraged to be creative when it comes to creating a burger, because you will be devouring that burger eventually!). The next steps are to enter the burger in the blank white box below, and hit submit.

3. Once you hit submit, a new button will be randomly generated, which when clicked will then push the name of your burger to a list. If you haven't yet devoured that burger, it will remain a clickable button.

One thing that I am still working on, is to seperate burgers that have been created, and burgers that have been devoured. In this project, a burger name that's still a button means it has yet to be devoured, while solid text represents that the burger has already been devoured!
